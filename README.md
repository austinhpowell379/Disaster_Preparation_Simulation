# Disaster_Preparation_Simulation
This code simulates a disaster evacuation scenario where populations are trying to evacuate using roads. The goal is to determine the best road(s) to retrofit before a disaster to maximize the population able to evacuate. Specifically, this code creates a 4x4 grid network of road with two populations located in adjacent corners. The evacuation point is on a separate corner. Each road has a probability of becoming impassable depending on what risk it has and whether it has been retrofitted. Then, we simulate the disaster with a single road retrofitted (2000 replications) and produce the average evacuation with associated confidence interval. We do this for each road and determine the best road to retrofit. We can continue this process leaving this road retrofitted to find more roads to retrofit. We used Common Random Numbers to reduce variance and decrease runtime.
